High level Overview planning:

*construction of levels could use factory creational pattern design.
*Same with creation of different items???
*Need to ensure we have only one Game class, so singleton pattern possibly?

*Game class:
*Starts the game, ends the game, would be in charge of the main loop, aka spawn the specific level
*change the level, end the game really would be it

*Level Class:
*defines initial descriptor, has specific NPC's in each, specific leave conditions maybe?, specific
*items to be obtained by the player, and clues.

*Player Class:
*has an inventory, can do specific actions when prompted: Use [item]: allows player to use specific 
*items that can actually be used like a key. Talk [NPC]: allows player to talk to NPC maybe more idk

*NPC Class:
*gives player dialogue when prompted, depends on what player chooses to say. May hold items of their
*own, so have their own inventory too?

*inventory:
*Basically a vector holder each Player or NPC Can have, a vector of items

*Items:
*just items.  could be classified as clues, in which case those items don't do nothing, aka don't use
*them but they give player clues. But again could also be used like keys and stuff.
